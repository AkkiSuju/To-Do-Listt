         Framework, and we came to know about it by
         going through the documentation available
         on GitHub/CocoaPods.
         
         We even could have a very simple statement as
         given below to apply the random colour -
         
         cell.backgroundColor = UIColor.randomFlat
         
         But, the problem with this above statement is,
         it generates a random colour for our rows that
         keeps on changing after every re-load.  To keep
         the colour unchanged for a row, we need to
         persist it i.e. store it in our DB, and for that
         we need to get colour's hex-value.
         
         We are grabbing the hex-value of the colour
         below, inside addButtonPressed method, and
         retrieving that here to implement on the cell.
         
         Here we are doing Optional Chaining that says,
         if CATEGORIES is not NIL then grab the colour
         (hex-value), and apply on the cell; else, use
         the default colour (1D9BF6), which we have
         explicitly defined here, on the cell.

         marks in the statement; they all are the result
         of suggestions provided by Xcode, and I think
         doing force-unwrapping here is safe. */
