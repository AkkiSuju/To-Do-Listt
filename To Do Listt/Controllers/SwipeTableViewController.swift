     It will allow user to swipe the row/item till mid-way
     that he wants to delete, and make the DELETE icon
     visible. On clicking the icon, this method gets
     triggered, and the item gets deleted.
     
     If you read the code carefully then will see that the
     1st statement says that the swipe orientation should
     be right i.e. cell should be swiped from right-to-left.
     
     In another block (SwipeAction), you have to give your
     own code that will be triggered when user clicks on
     the DELETE icon that appears while swipping the cell.
     
     For the 3rd statement we will have to store a delete
     or trash image in our app as a delete icon.  We can
     use any relevant image, but it would be better if we
     get it right from the SwipeCellKit example on the GitHub.

             the superclass, because superclass provides only
             the functionality to the subclass, but it
             doesn't perform any function explicitly for the
             subclass.
             
             So, we have created another method for deleting
             purpose, at the bottom of this file, and calling
             that method here.  We are also passing the index
             no of the row that is marked/swiped for deletion.
