         characters will be wiped out from the search bar.
         So, the count of the characters will be zero. */
        if searchBar.text?.count == 0

            loadItems()
            
            /* When user clicks the cross button to cancel
             his search criteria, the whole item list appears.
             But, keyboard remains visible, and the cursor
             still blinks inside the search bar.  To get over
             this, we use the below block of code.
             
             Whenever we writing methods to affect user
             interface, we tend to want it to happen in the
             fore-ground. Such as here we want to remove the
             on-screen keyboard and the cursor from within
             the search bar.  In order to do that, we have
             to tap into the DispatchQueue, which manages
             the execution of work items.  It assigns the
             works to different threads.
             
             Here we are asking it to grab us the main
             thread where we will update the user-interface
             elements.  So, essentially we are asking the
             DispatchQueue to get the main queue and then run
             the resignFirstResponder method on the main
             queue.
             
             resignFirstResponder method takes over the
             control from an element of being the first
             responder to the user, and pushes it back
             from the front, not appearance-wise but
             priority-wise.  So, because Search Bar won't
             be the first responder to the user on the
             invocation of this method, therefore, the
             Keyboard and the cursor will disappear.
             */
            
            DispatchQueue.main.async
            {
                searchBar.resignFirstResponder()
            }
            
            
        }
    }
