     within the Navigation Bar of our
     ToDoListViewController, such as -
     
     1. The colour of the bar as per the colour
        of the Category Item.
     2. The tile of the View Controller as per
        the name of the clicked Category.
     3. Background colour of the Search Bar, which
        is by-default grey, as per the colour of
        the Category
     
     navigationController is a default property
     that belongs to Navigation Controller.  If the
     View Controller is embedded in a Navigation
     Controller, then this property allows you to
     access the Navigation Controller.  This
     property is nil if the View Controller is
     not embedded inside a navigation controller.
     
     One imp. thing to note here is that we are not
     putting this code, to set the Navigation Bar
     colour, inside viewDidLoad method, rather we
     have used another imp method from the UI View
     Controller's life-cycle, which is - viewWillAppear.
     
     Just because the View has been loaded up
     does not mean that it has been embedded in
     Navigation Controller too.  It's very much
     possible that when our View is getting stacked
     on the Navigation Controller, right at that
     time the viewDidLoad method gets called, which
     can result the crash.
     
     Therefore, viewWillAppear is the right place
     to place this code that will set the colour
     of the Navigation Bar.
     */
    
    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool)
    {
        if let colourHex = selectedCategory?.colour
        {
            /* First of all, we are checking if the
             Navigation Controller is been initialized or
             not.  If yes, then store its reference in
             navBar variable, and if not, then throw an error.
             
             Now, what is this GUARD?  It's is very much
             similar to Optional Binding (the IF LET
             statement), but better to use in that case,
             when you don't have to do anything special,
             if the condition evaluates to False.
             
             However, IF LET should be used, when you want
             to do something even with the False condition.
             And of course, for False situation ELSE part
             is used.
             
             So, when you have to define something in ELSE
             part also, use IF LET; otherwise, use GUARD.
             Guard also uses Else part, but just to throw
             error. */

             ToDoListViewController, which is by-default
             set as - To Do List, same to the clicked
             Category's name.

             Button Item) to DEFAULT through the

     The reason for doing so is, when we click on the
     back button to go to the Category View, the colour
     scheme of the Navigation Bar (of
     ToDoListViewController) also gets carried away, and
     gets implemented on the Navigation Bar of the

     This method gets called when the View is just about
     to be removed, therefore, is the right place where
     we can set the colour of the Navigation Bar back to
     the original so that the original colour gets
     carried away to the Category View Controller.*/

         this time of course the Navigation Bar would
         have been initialized. */

     The above two methods - viewWillAppear and

     Angela has defined a common method for this
     colour setting work, and that method she has
     called in both these methods.  However, what
     Angela has done is a good programming approach,
     but I find it a little complex, therefore I am
     not doing any such modifications in my code.
     
     To see Angela's code, please see the video -
     Updating the UI of Navigation Bar (Section 19,
     Lecture 274, at 23rd minute.). */

             main Category.
             
             But, as we want to give the items in our
             ToDoListViewController a gradient effect,
             therefore, we are appending the darken() method
             to it.
             
             The darken() method takes a CGFloat value to
             decide the darkness.  The min CGFloat value
             can be 0 and max value can be 1.  And the
             
             Here we are deciding the darkness of the colour
             on the basis of the row no.  Initial rows will
             be lighter and final rows will be darker.
             
             This is the general form of the statement-
             
             let color = <initial expr.>.darken(byPercentage: CGFloat)
             
             But we have converted it into the below as per our
             requirement
             
             Two more thing to mind here-
             1. we are doing forced unwrapping for
             toDoItems, because we already have done
             Optional Binding for it above, so, it's safe
             here to go with forced-unwrapping.
             
             2. we have converted indexPath.row and
             toDoItems.count into CGFloat individually, and
             then divided them.  However, we could have
             divided them, and then got converted into
             CGFloat.  But the reason of not doing so is
             well explained in video - Creating Gradient
             Flow Cells (Section 19, Lecture 273, at 8.30
             minutes)

             But, keyboard remains visible, and the cursor
             still blinks inside the search bar.  To get over
             this, we use the below block of code.

             Whenever we writing methods to affect user
             interface, we tend to want it to happen in the
             fore-ground. Such as here we want to remove the
             on-screen keyboard and the cursor from within
             the search bar.  In order to do that, we have
             to tap into the DispatchQueue, which manages
             the execution of work items.  It assigns the
             works to different threads.

             Here we are asking it to grab us the main
             thread where we will update the user-interface
             elements.  So, essentially we are asking the
             DispatchQueue to get the main queue and then run
             the resignFirstResponder method on the main
             queue.

             resignFirstResponder method takes over the
             control from an element of being the first
             responder to the user, and pushes it back
             from the front, not appearance-wise but
             priority-wise.  So, because Search Bar won't
             be the first responder to the user on the
             invocation of this method, therefore, the
             Keyboard and the cursor will disappear.
             */

            DispatchQueue.main.async
            {
                searchBar.resignFirstResponder()
            }
