     File Manager provides a convenient
     interface to the contents of the file
     system.
     
     Here we are tapping into Document Directory,
     and we are looking for it inside User Domain
     Mask i.e. user's home directory, that place
     where we are saving their personal items
     associated with this app.
     
     The urls method returns an array of URLs for
     the specified directory, so, we are grabbing
     its first item.
     
     We are adding a component i.e. a file to this
     path, which is a plist file in this case.
     And we will use this file to save user data
     persistently. */

    /* What we doing with this below statement is,
     we are getting a reference (view context) of
     persistentContainer i.e. our SQLite database,
     and saving it in a variable named context.
     
     And how we are doing this; we are tapping into
     the UIApplication class, getting its shared
     singleton object that communicates with the
     current app as an object.
     
     Then we are tapping into its delegate that is
     knows as App Delegate, and down-casting it into
     our AppDelegate class so that we get able to
     access the persistentContainer property of
     AppDelegate class, and then finally could grab
     its viewContext.
